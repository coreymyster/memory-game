# Memory Game

This project is my very own version of the Udacity Front End Web Developer Degree "Memory Game" project in the "Web Programming With JavaScript" section. I have built this project from the ground up using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repo using git.

Open index.html and click the cards to immediately begin playing.

## Premise of the Game

Players must match all 16 cards, or 8 sets of combinations. Clicking on each card will reveal the item below the card - if 2 clicks do not match, the cards will turn back over however if 2 cards do match they will remain visible while the player matches the remaining cards.

The number of correct guesses, the player score measured by the amount of clicks the player takes and a restart button are visible at the top of the card grid.

Once the player guesses all correct combinations a screen will display the player's score and a button allowing the player to play the game again.
